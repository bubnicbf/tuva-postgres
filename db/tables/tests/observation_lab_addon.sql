-- db/tests/observation_lab_addon.sql
-- Lab-focused add-on checks for observations.
-- Expects psql vars: :"schema"
SET search_path TO :"schema", public;

-- Heuristics:
-- - A unit implies numeric if it matches common lab unit patterns (case-insensitive)
-- - We'll parse numbers from strings by stripping commas and picking the first numeric token
-- - Allowed non-numeric tokens when units imply numeric (to avoid false alarms):
--   POSITIVE/NEGATIVE/DETECTED/NOT DETECTED/REACTIVE/NONREACTIVE/TRACE/UNDETECTABLE
